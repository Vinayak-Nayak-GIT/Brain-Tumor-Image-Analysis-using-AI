Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing Healthcare in many areas such as:
Disease Diagnosis with medical imaging,
Surgical Robots,
Maximizing Hospital Efficiency.

Al healthcare market is expected to reach $45.2 billion USD
by 2026 from the current valuation of $4.9 billion USD.

In this case study, assume that you work as an AI/ML consultant and you have been hired by a medical diagnosis company in NYC.
You have been tasked to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting and localizing brain tumors based on MRI scans. This would drastically reduce the cost of cancer diagnosis & help in early diagnosis of tumors which would essentially be a life saver.
The team has collected brain MRI scans and have approached you to develop a model that could detect and localize tumors. â€¢ You have been provided with 3929 Brain MRI scans along with their brain tumour location.
