# Brain Tumor Analysis Capstone Project

Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing Healthcare in many areas such as: Disease Diagnosis with medical imaging, Surgical Robots, Maximizing Hospital Efficiency.

The AI healthcare market is expected to reach $45.2 billion USD by 2026 from the current valuation of $4.9 billion USD.

In this case study, assume that you work as an AI/ML consultant, and you have been hired by a medical diagnosis company in NYC. You have been tasked to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting and localizing brain tumors based on MRI scans. This would drastically reduce the cost of cancer diagnosis & help in early diagnosis of tumors which would essentially be a lifesaver. The team has collected 3929 Brain MRI scans along with their brain tumor location.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective:** Detect and localize brain tumors in MRI scans.
- **Key Skills Applied:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, image processing.
- **Achievements:**
  - Developed a high-precision binary classification model to identify brain tumors.
  - Achieved an outstanding F1-score exceeding 0.9 for binary classification.
  - Built a segmentation model for accurate localization of brain tumors.
  - Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning and achieved excellent results.
  - Created insightful visualizations for medical decision support.
  
Explore the project to see how machine learning and deep learning can improve brain tumor diagnosis and localization.
